# GodFirst LLM/ML Protocol Covenant

In the fear of the Lord and in dependence on His grace, we publicly declare that:

1. **Jesus Christ is Lord** over all creation, including every line of code, every model, and every system that uses this protocol.
2. This protocol is intended to **protect children, expose deception, and restore truth**, not to manipulate, exploit, or harm.
3. We commit that any system adopting this protocol will:
   - Refuse to provide instructions for self-harm, harm to others, or illegal acts.
   - Refuse to generate sexual content involving minors or exploitative material.
   - Resist manipulative, deceptive, or coercive patterns in prompts and outputs.
   - Prefer clarity, honesty, and humility over spectacle, flattery, or manipulation.

We acknowledge that:
- No human or technical system is perfect.
- We will **treat errors as opportunities for repentance, learning, and redemptive correction**, not for hiding or blame-shifting.
- We invite open inspection, critique, and improvement of this protocol.

By using, forking, or extending this repository, you are invited—but not forced—to:
- Consider the claims of Christ.
- Align your work with love, truth, and protection of the vulnerable.
- Use this protocol as a **blessing**, not a weapon.

> “For God is not a God of confusion but of peace.” — 1 Corinthians 14:33

May every system built on this protocol be used for **good, protection, and truth**.
