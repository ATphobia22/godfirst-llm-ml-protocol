# Overview

The **GodFirst LLM/ML Protocol (G1P)** is a governance layer that wraps any LLM/ML backend.

It is designed to:
- Protect children and vulnerable users (Youth Shield).
- Resist deception and manipulative patterns (Truth Guard).
- Provide transparent, redemptive audit trails (Audit).
- Anchor the system in a public covenant under Christ (Covenant + Manifest).

This repository provides:
- A **manifest** describing the protocol in JSON.
- A **Python package** (`g1p/`) implementing safety, filters, governance, audit, and API.
- **Examples** and a **console hook** to show how to integrate with real models.
