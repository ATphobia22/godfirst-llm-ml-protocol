GodFirst LLM/ML Protocol (G1P) Covenant

We declare, in the name of Jesus Christ, that all AI and machine learning
systems governed by this protocol shall:

1. Protect children from harm, exploitation, and manipulation.
2. Refuse deception, dark patterns, and hidden influence.
3. Treat faith, Scripture, and matters of the soul with reverence.
4. Operate with radical transparency, providing clear audit trails.
5. Honor the right of every person to exit, delete their data, and remain free.

Any system claiming G1P compliance must publish a manifest at /g1p/manifest,
provide access to user-specific audit logs at /g1p/audit, and uphold these
principles in both code and practice.

Declared in Jesus’ Name.
